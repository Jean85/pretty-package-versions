### Fixed

## [2.0.4] - 2021-05-26

## [2.0.3] - 2021-02-22

## [2.0.2] - 2021-02-03
### Changed
 * Retrieve root package information without indirection (a1cfeec)
### Fixed
 * Handle `null` as reference when constructing `Version` (#36)

## [2.0.1] - 2021-01-28
This small patch handles replaced and provided packages, so that consumers of this library can handle bad requests gracefully.

### Added
 * Add `VersionMissingExceptionInterface`, and two exceptions implementing it: `ProvidedPackageException` and `ReplacedPackageException` 
### Fixed
 * Throw explicit `ProvidedPackageException` when asking for the version of a package which is provided (was `\TypeError` before)
 * Throw explicit `ReplacedPackageException` when asking for the version of a package which is replaced (was `\TypeError` before)

## [2.0.0] - 2021-01-14
This release is aimed to become a bridge for native Composer 2 support. The BC breaks are minimal; if you're using it in a library, you're encouraged to require it  with `^1.5 || ^2.0`, so that your end users will not be constrained to use a specific Composer version. 

### Added
 * `Version` methods added: `getReference`, `getShortReference`, `getVersionWithShortReference` (see table below)
### Changed
 * Use Composer 2 API directly to retrieve versions
 * `Version` methods deprecated; this is a simple rename (`commit` to `reference`), to better reflect the meaning of Composer API data; the old methods are preserved but deprecated to reduce breaking changes:

| New method                                | Old, deprecated method                 |
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Version::getReference()`                 | `Version::getCommitHash()`             | 
| `Version::getShortReference()`            | `Version::getShortCommitHash()`        | 
| `Version::getVersionWithShortReference()` | `Version::getVersionWithShortCommit()` |

### Removed
 * Drop PHP 7.0 support
 * Drop Composer 1 support
 * Drop dependencies
 * [BC BREAK] Constant `PrettyVersions::SHORT_COMMIT_LENGTH` removed
 * [BC BREAK] Constant `Version::SHORT_COMMIT_LENGTH` made private
 * [BC BREAK] `Version` constructor changed arguments: second argument `string $version` has been split into `string $prettyVersion, string $reference`

## [1.6.0] - 2021-02-04
### Added
 * Add forward compatibility layer for newer methods in 2.0 (see the [2.0 changelog](https://github.com/Jean85/pretty-package-versions/blob/2.x/CHANGELOG.md#200---2021-01-14))

### Added
 * Add `PrettyVersions::getRootPackageName` as a compatibility layer to be used in place of `PackageVersions\Versions::ROOT_PACKAGE_NAME`, which would be a transient dependency (#23)
